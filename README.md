# Neuron
Neural network from first principals 

This implementation is heavily inspired by Karpathy's
[micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd). Think of this as a rust implementation for the
same.

@danielway has already published this
[here](https://github.com/danielway/micrograd-rs/tree/master). I have referenced his work to make
the rust compiler happy at times.

The focus is on understanding and not on efficiency.
